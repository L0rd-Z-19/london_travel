In this project I took an data set that I used in an older project from my bootcamp where I worked in a group to transform data into a database. I took the old data and created four new tables for my analysis to be done on. Sending the new tables into my jupyter notebook, I created four new plots. Putting them on a handcrafted website, I visualized the data for all too see.
