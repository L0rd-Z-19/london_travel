                The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equatir. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visulizations created as part of the analisis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

                    As one might expect, the graph shows a trend where the closer one is to the equator, the warmer one becomes. However, uppon closer inspection, one might also ask "Why is -60 warmer than 60?" This is due to the time of year and the natural differences between the northern and southern hemispheres. This data was originally collected on January fith of 2017. At this point in the year the southern hemisphere is typically warmer then the northern.

                    At first, when one observes this plot, it might be hard to know where to look. Part of that is because this chart does not appear to have any trends, but also because most of the points are at the top. The Conclusion that should be drawn from this plot is that there is not enough statistical difference between the humidity in the northern and southern hemispheres to claim there is a difference.                </p>

                    Looking at this plot, it can be seen that the slight majority of the points are on the right side of the plot. This might lead one to claim the northern hemisphere has stronger winds than the southern. However, due to the layout of the data it cannot be declaired that the nothern hemisphere is statistically different. I did however take the time to research why the slight increase may have occered in the north. Once again it has to do with the seasons, wind likes to move from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower. Since this data was collected during the northern hemisphere's winter, the concentration of wind is going to be higher in the north rather than the south.
